   /* Brute force method   
      
      We simply go through the process by running two loops and going through each possibility. 
      I do not think this is an effcient method of doing it. I believe that the Big-O runtime is O(N^2)     
      because it will go through the arrays again if it has found a match. 

      Best case: O(n) ---> If the circuit cannot be completed at all. 
      Worse case: O(n^2) ---> If the circuit can be completed then we will have to go the array starting at the 
                              beginning.
